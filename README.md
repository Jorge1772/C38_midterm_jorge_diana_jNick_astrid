Social Doggy Distance

We are an easy to manage way to search for local dog parks with just one click, the site will also link to a series of FAQ’s explaining the risks of COVID-19 to pets and humans.

Although it is a fully fledged project, there are always improvements to be done to Social Doggy Distance. In the future we would like to add geo-tracking to display the number of active people in each park.

Social Doggy Distance was created to help people and dogs in isolation find a local park where they can burn energy while still maintaining safe social distance.
